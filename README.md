# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing with MATLAB

Welcome to the Image Processing repository! Here, you'll find MATLAB code for various feature extraction techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF). These techniques are fundamental in the field of computer vision and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from facial recognition to object detection.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To dive into these feature extraction methods, make sure you have MATLAB installed on your machine. Clone this repository, and you're ready to explore the diverse techniques available in MATLAB for image processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques Covered

- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**: Useful for object detection, HOG captures edge or gradient structure that is characteristic of local shape.

- **LBP (Local Binary Patterns)**: An effective texture descriptor, LBP is used for various applications such as facial recognition.

- **SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features)**: A robust local feature detector, SURF is used in tasks like object recognition and 3D reconstruction.

Each folder within this repository corresponds to one of these techniques and contains sample code demonstrating its application.

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Get a local copy of this repository by cloning it.
   
`git clone https://github.com/sonainjameel/Image_Processing.git`

2. **Navigate to Technique Folder**: Choose the feature extraction technique you're interested in and navigate to its corresponding folder.

3. **Run the Scripts**: Open the MATLAB scripts in the folder and run them to see the feature extraction technique in action.

Feel free to experiment with the code and apply the techniques to your own image datasets!
